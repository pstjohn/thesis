Latex source files for my PhD thesis. I ended up abandoning using any pre-done
style files (like "ucthesis") since they ended up having style choices that
seemed to go against the current recommendations.

Ultimately it wasn't very hard to put together a styling that was fairly close
to the word document (albeit much prettier, 'cause \LaTeX). The title page,
signature page, copyright page are just hacked together in the preamble
directory. I also included a new float type, models, since I wanted an easy way
to refer to them throughout the document.
