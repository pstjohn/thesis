\chapter{Introduction}
Systems biology is a multidisciplinary field, drawing from biology, mathematics, and computer science. 
In this chapter, I first provide a background on the biology of circadian rhythms, followed by an introduction to the computational techniques which have been used to study them. 

\section{Biological background}

Ecological competition drives species to optimize their survival and reproduction in a particular environmental niche. 
Aspects of their environment, including temperature, resource availability, and sunlight are all important factors in determining an individual's success.

In nearly all environments, however, these factors vary greatly from hour to hour and month to month. 
While food or sunlight might be plentiful during daylight hours, the threat of predators might peak as well. 
Fortunately, while these critical parameters undergo sharp changes, they do so with a predictable and repeatable schedule. 
It is not surprising that, in optimizing their survival in an oscillating environment, species have developed a means to predict changes and to ready themselves for the correct behavior.

\subsection{Evolutionary history}
By looking at the evolutionary history of circadian rhythms, Edgar and colleges \cite{Edgar2012} demonstrated that cellular timekeeping may have began as a response to the Great Oxidation Event occurring $\approx 2.5$ billion years ago. 
Due to increased oxygen levels, the generation of reactive oxygen species in the cell can lead to oxidation of key biomolecules, prompting cells to express scavenging mechanisms during times of high UV light exposure. 
Over time, these pathways coupled to transcription-translation feedback loops in individual organisms, giving rise to a diverse set of circadian regulatory pathways (\fref{fig:edgarros}, from \cite{Edgar2012}).

Biological rhythms are classified as {\em circadian} if they display a number of defining characteristics:
\begin{itemize}
  \item They are {\em endogenous}, meaning they continue to oscillate even when the organism is isolated from its environment

  \item They are temperature compensated, maintaining a consistent period for moderate changes in average temperature

  \item They are {\em entrainable}, meaning they can adjust their phase and period in response to a changing in environmental signal

  \item They oscillate with a roughly 24 hour period \cite{Dunlap2009}.
\end{itemize}
